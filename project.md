A repository containing Python dependency requirements primarily for finance-related projects. This repo centralizes and manages Python package versions to ensure reproducibility and consistency across environments.

## Features

- Comprehensive list of Python dependencies pinned to specific versions.
- Focus on finance and geospatial libraries.
- Supports integration with Google Cloud services and Jupyter environments.

## Tech Stack

- Python packages for finance, data processing, and geospatial analysis.
- Libraries include Flask, geopandas, google-cloud SDKs, Jupyter ecosystem, and more.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/python_reqs.git
cd python_reqs
```

Install dependencies listed in the requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r finance/requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

```
python_reqs/
└── finance/
    └── requirements.txt  # Pinned Python dependencies for finance-related projects
```

- `finance/requirements.txt`: Contains a curated list of Python packages with exact versions, covering data analysis, geospatial processing, cloud integration, and visualization.

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Expand requirements files for other domains or projects.
- Add scripts or tooling to automate environment setup.
- Include documentation on usage scenarios for the requirements.
- Version control and dependency update automation.
